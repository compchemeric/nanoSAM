Nanoscale Characterization of Self-Assembled-Monolayers and tethered Lipid Bilayers and Vesicles

The scripts above were used in our article "Simulation of Mixed Self-Assembled Monolayers on Gold: Effect of Terminal Alkyl Anchor Chain and Monolayer Composition", published in J. Phys. Chem. B, 2018, 122 (31), pp 7699â€“7710 under the DOI: 0.1021/acs.jpcb.8b05075. 

They should work with any molecular dynamics trajcetory data of self-assembled monolayer systems and allow for a quick computation of lattice constant, tilt angles, and thickness, order paramters as well as trans- and helical ratios.

The output can be written to either text or numpy files. Examples and some more documentation will follow soon.
